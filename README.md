# Code For lab 1 
### Part a in C 
I encountered issues trying to add the entire folder with all project code so I have just included the code changes were made to after creating a brand new stm32 project for the f411RE board
Changes include:
- edited main.c

### Part a in assembly
Same thing as the C code, I have only added the files that I either changed or created to get the ASM code to run
Changes / creations include:
- edited main.c
- created assembler.h
- created assembler.s
